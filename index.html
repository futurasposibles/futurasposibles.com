<span style="--font-scale: 1.73;">Hola, I am Gabriela Parra SÃ¡nchez. <br>
Welcome to the final archive and documentation of my bachelor thesis.<br><br>
Futuras Posibles is a journey, or more like several journeys at once-that <br>
embraces many cracks: my own and those of those who accompany <br>
me in this process of migrating.<br><br>

<br>
In order to understand it better I recommend you to enjoy this quick <br>

times when [I wanted to be invisible and yet wanted to belong]; what I <br>
[transit], [transform], and, above all, how I find rest in [the weaving through <br>
dialogue] with those walking through a similar process. 
To finally [achieve] <br>
one of my biggest dreams and this milestone which is finishing my studies.<br>

<br>
Thank to this process I learned that [I needed to inhabit the in-between to <br>
remember that there I can find bliss too].<br>

<br>
[Thank you] for taking the time to explore this journey and I hope you enjoy <br>
watching it as much as I did creating it.</span><br>
